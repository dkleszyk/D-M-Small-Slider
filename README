What is this?
-------------

D@M Small Slider (DSS) is a lightweight, self-contained javascript 
package designed to create a semantic slider that can be easily 
styled and themed with external css. The goal of DSS is to fufill 
the statement "when less is more than enough".


Changes since last release
--------------------------

*   Captions no longer animate. Captions will toggle between visible 
    or hidden during transitions. 

*   'delta-t' and 'n-steps' removed as options. 

*   'duration' added as new option to control animation length. 

*   'tween' added as new option to allow for custom easing functions. 

*   Default easing function is now SineInOut. 
    
*   Uses modular arithmetic for TRDL directions instead of conditions. 

*   UglifyJS used for minification. Minified file is now 720 bytes 
    smaller. 

*   Animations now use requestAnimationFrame instead of setTimeout. 

*   Restructured code into module system. Increased usage of closures 
    to leak fewer variables. 


Usage
-----

Using DSS is easy. If you want to add in a slider with the default 
values, first add the css link in the head of your document.

    <link rel="stylesheet" href="dss.css" type="text/css" media="screen" />

Next, in the body of your document, make sure you have a definintion 
list set up with the slides you want to use in your slider.

    <dl id='your_id_here' class='dss'>
        <dt><a href='...' title='' ><img src='...' alt='' /></a></dt>
            <dd><p>...</p></dd>
    </dl>

Then, at the end of you document, link to the DSS Javascript file and 
add the following code.

    <script src='dss.js' type='text/javascript' ></script>
    <script type='text/javascript' >
    //<![CDATA[
        var s = dss.slider('your_id_here');
    //]]>
    </script>

The slider should be created, and start playing with a dwell of five 
seconds per slide. 


Advanced usage
--------------

Various methods are available for use if you want to tie in DSS 
with other javascript operations. These methods are


start 
:   Starts the slider change timer.

stop
:   Stops the slide change timer.

restart 
:   Restarts the slide change timer. _Does not set slide back
    to start value_

slide(direction, ftl-override = null)
:   Causes a transition in the direction specified (options 
    being 'top', 'right', 'bottom', 'left', and 'random'). If
    the ftl-override is set, the slideshow will be advanced that 
    many slides (ftl-override should be an integer). 

dir() 
:   Gets the default forward transition direction. 

ndir() 
:   Gets the default reverse transition direction. 


To set various options for the DSS slider, you can pass an options
object as the second argument to the slider. Available options are


dwell 
:   Time between slide changes in milliseconds. Default 5000.

ftl 
:   First-to-last. If false, slides go in reverse order. 
    Default true.

new-slides 
:   Dynamically add slides to the slider. Array of objects. 
    Objects have properties 'content' and 'caption', 
    which refer respectively to the inner HTML of the slide 
    and caption. Captions added this way should include a 
    <p></p> tag. Default empty array.

start
:   What slide to start at in the range [1,n]. Default 1.

duration
:   The time in milliseconds it takes to transition between 
    slides. Default 750. 

direction
:   What direction slides should move in while animating. Can 
    be left, right, top, bottom, or random. Default right.

autostart
:   Whether the animation timer should start when the slider
    is created. Default true.
    
tween 
:   The easing function to use for transitions. Takes the form of 
    function(t, b, c, d). Default is SineInOut. 
    
    
### Example 1

    var s = dss.slider('your_id_here',{
        'new-slides' : [
            {'content' :
              "<a href='#' title='' ><img src='image-2.jpg' alt='' /></a>",
            'caption' : 
              '<p>another caption to boot!</p>'},
            {'content' :
              "<a href='#' title='' ><img src='image-3.jpg' alt='' /></a>",
            'caption' : 
              '<p>Wowee! Three slides!</p>'}
        ]
    });
    
    Creates a slider with two additional slides added. The added slides 
    contain images and have captions.
    
### Example 2

    var s = dss.slider('your_id_here',{'autostart':false});
    s.start();
    
    Creates a slider that will not start using the 'autostart' 
    option, then manually starts it with the start command.
