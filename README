Author: David J. Kleszyk, 2011



What is this?

  D@M Small Slider (DSS) is a lightweight, self-contained javascript 
  package designed to create a semantic slider that can be easily 
  styled and themed with external css. The goal of DSS is to fufill 
  the statement "when less is more than enough".
  
  DSS has been tested in Firefox 6.0

  - First release



Usage

  Using DSS is easy. If you want to add in a slider with the default 
  values, first add the css link in the head of your document.
  
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="dss.css" type="text/css" media="screen" />
    
  Next, in the body of your document, make sure you have a definintion 
  list set up with the slides you want to use in your slider.
  
    <dl id='...' class='dss'>
        <dt><a href='...' title='' ><img src='...' alt='' /></a></dt>
            <dd><p>...</p></dd>
    </dl>
    
  Then, at the end of you document, link to the DSS Javascript file and 
  add the following code.
  
    <script src='dss.js' type='text/javascript' ></script>
    <script type='text/javascript' >
    //<![CDATA[
        var s = dss('...');
    //]]>
    </script>
    
  Where the argument for dss() is the id of the definition list element
  in your document.



Advanced usage

    Various methods are available for use if you want to tie in DSS 
    with other javascript operations. These methods are
    
        - start 
            : Starts the slider change timer.
        - stop
            : Stops the slide change timer.
        - restart 
            : Restarts the slide change timer. *Does not set slide back
              to start value*
        - slide(direction, ftl-override = false, ftl-parameter = false)
            : Causes a transition in the direction specified (options 
              being 'top', 'right', 'bottom', 'left', and 'random'). If
              the ftl-override is set to true, the ftl-parameter will 
              set the order of the change, with true making the 
              transition to the next slide and false making the 
              transition to the previous slide.
        - dir() 
            : Gets the default forward transition direction. 
        - ndir() 
            : Gets the default reverse transition direction. 

    To set various options for the DSS slider, you can pass an options
    object as the second argument to the slider. Available options are
    
        - dwell 
            : Time between slide changes in milliseconds. Default 5000.
        - ftl 
            : First-to-last. If false, goes in reverse order. 
              Default true.
        - new-slides 
            : Dynamically add slides to the slider. Array of objects. 
              Objects have properties 'content' and 'caption', 
              which refer respectively to the inner HTML of the slide 
              and caption. Captions added this way should include a 
              <p></p> tag. Default empty array.
        - start
            : What slide to start at in the range [1,n]. Default 1.
        - delta-t 
            : The incremental time step for the animation timer. Total 
              animation time is delta-t times n-steps.
        - n-steps 
            : The number of steps for each animation. Total animation 
              time is delta-t times n-steps.
        - direction
            : What direction slides should move in while animating. Can 
              be left, right, top, bottom, or random. Default right.
        - autostart
            : Whether the animation timer should start when the slider
              is created. Default true.
        
    Example 1
    
        var s = dss('slider',{
            'new-slides' : [
                {'content' :
                  "<a href='#' title='' ><img src='image-2.jpg' alt='' /></a>",
                'caption' : 
                  '<p>another caption to boot!</p>'},
                {'content' :
                  "<a href='#' title='' ><img src='image-3.jpg' alt='' /></a>",
                'caption' : 
                  '<p>Wowee! Three slides!</p>'}
            ]
        });
        
        Creates a slider of dl with id 'slider' with two additional 
        slides added on, with images and captions.
        
    Example 2
    
        var s = dss('slider',{'autostart':false});
        s.start();
        
        Creates a slider that will not start using the 'autostart' 
        option, then manually starts it with the start command.
